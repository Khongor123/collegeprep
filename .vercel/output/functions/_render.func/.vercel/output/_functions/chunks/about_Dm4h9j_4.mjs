Many successful applicants have capitalized on this growing issue and started selling courses to help other students achieve what they did. But oftentimes, these courses are overly expensive and make students lose hope just because of that.\r\n\r\nWe present to you, CollegeArt, a complete _**free**_ website aimed at providing every student with equal opportunities, packing all of the information covered by the college prep programs into a single _**central hub**_.\r\n\r\nWe believe that everyone deserves to be educated equally, as so our purpose, and we plan to debunk the entire college application process, making it easier for everyone.\r\n\r\nThank you, and good luck on your journey.";
