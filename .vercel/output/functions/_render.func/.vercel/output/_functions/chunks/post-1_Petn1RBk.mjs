A person doesn’t have to work in a specific profession to demonstrate the important qualities and characteristics of a professional. Professionalism leads to workplace success, a strong professional reputation and a high level of work ethic and excellence.\r\n\r\nIn a recent study on **Career Readiness** conducted by NACE (National Association of Colleges and Employers), employers who hire college graduates were asked which professional competencies were essential to workplace success. Professionalism/work ethic topped the list with 97.5% of respondents identifying it as either “absolutely essential” or “essential” for a new college hire’s success.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips to help you be more _Professional_:\r\n\r\n## Be more productive\r\n\r\nUse your time productively at work.
